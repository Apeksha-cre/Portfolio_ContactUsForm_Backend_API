# Portfolio_ContactUsForm_Backend_API

This repository contains the backend code for the "ContactUs" form in my portfolio website. The API provided here allows users to submit data from the form,
which will then be stored in the database. The main implementation is focused on the POST method for handling incoming data.

Features:

POST Method: The API implements a POST method that accepts data from the ContactUs form and stores it in the database. 

GET Method: For testing purposes, a GET method has also been included. This method can be tested using Postman, which will retrieve a list of all the entries in the database. Note that this method is intended for testing only and may be removed or restricted in a production environment.
